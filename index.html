				<i class="fa fa-user"></i> About Me
			</h3>
			<p class="rightP">
				I'm a high school junior in New Jersey who is learning to code. I may not know much now but I'm excited to learn!
			</p>
			<ul class="rightP">
				I've attended these hackathons:
				<li class="rightL"><i class="fa fa-square-o"></i> CodeDayNY</li>
				<li class="rightL"><i class="fa fa-square-o"></i> hackBCA</li>
				<li class="rightL"><i class="fa fa-square-o"></i> HackRU</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="rightP">
				Expect to find me at more hackathons in the NJ-NY area!
			</p>
			<h3>
				<i class="fa fa-wrench"></i> What I've made
			</h3>
			<p class="rightP">
				This is what I've worked on so far!
			</p>
			<h4>
				<i class="fa fa-magic"></i> SpellMaster
			</h4>
			<p class="rightP">
				This was the project my team worked on at CodeDayNY. It's an IOS game that uses swipe motions on the phone to move and attack. I did not know Objective-C so I provided artwork. Therefore, I did not actually code for this project, but it was the first thing I "worked" on so it gets a mention!
			</p>
			<h4>
				<i class="fa fa-fighter-jet"></i> Fighter Jet Takes the Sky
			</h4>
			<p class="rightP">
				This was the first project I actually coded for. This was made at hackBCA. My whole team was new to coding so we wanted to make a simple game. We found source code (we were hopeless without it) of the <a href="http://hawkee.com/snippet/6233/">"Helicopter Game"</a> and worked to make that the game we envisioned. Instead of a helicopter, we made a game where the user control a fighter jet and has to dodge missiles that gradually become faster. I was very proud of my team because we spent the first few hours of the hackathon clueless!
			</p>
			<p class="rightP">
				I've been working on the game on my own time at home. Here's the latest version! It's fast paced and addicting!

				<i class="fa fa-hand-o-up"></i> Elima-Click
			</h4>
			<p class="rightP">
				My team made this game at HackRU. It's very similar to Tetris, but it doesn't use any keyboard keys. Instead a player clicks blocks one at a time to change their color by cycling through five certain colors. The player must get a row to be the same color to eliminate it. Each time the player clicks, a randomly colored block will drop from a random column. The goal is to get as high of a score as possible without the blocks reaching the top of the grid. This was made purely in Java.
